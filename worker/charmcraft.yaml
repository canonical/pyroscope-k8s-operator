      Connect a single pyroscope-coordinator-k8s charm that will configure this node to work as 
      part of a distributed Pyroscope cluster. The charm needs this integration to work.

        Configure the application to run with all roles enabled. This is the default configuration. 
        This is a meta-role that configures the application to enable all other roles.
             
        If you want to configure this app to run with a role other than `all`, remember to set `all` to `false`.
        
        Note that for a pyroscope deployment as a whole to be consistent, each role needs to be assigned to at least one worker node. If this condition
        is not met, the coordinator charm will set blocked status and the deployment will shut down.
